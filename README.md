# LULC-Classification-of-Wular-Lake-using-GEE
This project performs a spatiotemporal Land Use–Land Cover (LULC) classification of the Wular Lake catchment, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, using satellite remote sensing data and machine learning


Objectives

Analyze long-term LULC changes (1991–2020) in the Wular Lake catchment

Classify major land cover types using machine learning

Quantify land cover change at catchment and sub-catchment levels

Identify key anthropogenic and environmental trends
